    <!-- Semantic HTML and Accessibility

1)Load your stylesheet after Google Fonts. Make sure your stylesheet is loaded after Google Fonts in the <head> of your document. This avoids styles being applied without the correct fonts, which can cause layout shifts. ✅

2)Avoid using words like "image," "photo," or "picture" in your alt attributes. Screen readers already announce that the element is an image. Focus on describing the content of the image succinctly and meaningfully. ✅

3)Use <strong> instead of <span> in lists when emphasizing important text. <strong> has semantic meaning, indicating importance, and acts as a label for the list items, improving accessibility. ✅



These changes will not only improve the accessibility and maintainability of your code but also help you develop solid practices for future projects. -->

                pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.You can add a
                tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.

                <strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Once the butter is melted
                and bubbling, pour in the eggs.Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs

                <strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong> When the eggs begin to
                set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle,
                sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fold and serve:</strong> As the omelette continues to
